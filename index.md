title: Data Exploration Methods using Python
---

Welcome to Data Exploration Methods using Python! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to Data Exploration Methods with the Python programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, transform, manipulate, and visualize data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility.

## Course Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

- Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment
- Manage different types of data
- Manage different data structures
- Import, scrape, and export data
- Index, subset, reshape and transform your data
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Visualize data with proper graphs
- Create interactive online dashboard 
- Write your own functions
- Perform iterative functions
- Try basic applied analytical models

...all with Python!

## Class Structure 

Each week you will read and work through selected tutorials on specific data exploration activities in Python.  In this class I blend external interactive reading modules via [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) where you will read chapters prior to each class session. Then in each class I'll spend the first part of class reviewing the data exploration activity and answer any burning questions. Then you will break up into defined small groups and work together to complete a data exploration problem prior to the end of class.  Thus, the majority of class time will be spent practicing and applying what you learned outside of the classroom.

The purpose for this course structure is multi-dimensional:

1. It will teach you how to read and learn Python programming tutorials and techniques on your own.  
2. The out-of-class modules will motivate you to come to each class prepared and these modules will also prepare you for your final project.  
3. The in-class small group work will teach you to work on a coding task collaboratively and within a constrained time limit and also teach you to assess other people's code.


## Material

All required classroom material will be provided in class or online. Any recommended yet optional material will also be provided in the classroom notes.

## Software

We will use JupyterLab from Anaconda during the course. Plan on bringing a computer to each class meeting.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) will be used to perform all programming activities, assignments, and the final project.  



## Fine Print

<u>Academic Integrity</u>: As with all Alvarez College of Business efforts, this course will uphold the highest ethical standards, which are critical to building character. Instructors are required to report ANY incident of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism) to the college review process, which could result in severe consequences, including potential dismissal from the college. For further information on Academic Misconduct or related university policies and procedures, please see the [UTSA Code of Conduct]().

（Add school policy here）For example: All cases of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, falsification) will be formally reported by faculty. Students will be afforded due process for allegations, as outlined in the policy. If a student is found guilty of academic misconduct in two instances, the student may be dismissed from the Alvarez College of Business. 


<u>Disability</u>: Students with disabilities who need academic accommodations or other specialized services while attending the University of Cincinnati will receive reasonable accommodations to meet their individual needs as well as advocacy assistance on disability-related issues. Students requiring special accommodation must register with the [Disability Services Office]().

<u>Attendance</u>: Your attendance is expected at every meeting. If you must be absent, I request that you notify me in advance of the class meeting.

<u>Grade appeals</u>: If you think the grade of your work (homework, peer reviews, participation) is miscalculated, you have the right to appeal. The appeal must be done (through email) within 7 calendar days since the grade is released/posted. After that, your grade is final and will not be changed.

<u>Acknowledgments</u>: I have drawn ideas or readings from the following syllabi:
