title: Week 1
---

Welcome to week 1! We only have 7 weeks together so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus ([electronic](http://zzz1990771.github.io/data_wrangling)) by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.  I will spend the first few minutes of class on Monday re-iterating a few points so that we are all on the same page but I do not want to spend 30-60 minutes doing so, so make sure you read (and re-read) it thoroughly.

The focus of this week is two-fold:

1. To get yourself (re-)introduced to R and the RStudio IDE.
2. To introduce you to base R data selection/manipulation/cleaning techniques. 

Below outlines the reading and homework that you complete before next week's class. The skills and functions introduced in these readings will be necessary for Monday's in-class activities. If you have any questions or concerns your can go to our teams channel and posting your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring teams channel to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching teams channel and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.
