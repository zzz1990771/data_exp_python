title: Week 5
---

Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use the `ggplot2` library to visualize your data. As illustrated in week 2, R does provide built-in plotting functions; however, the `ggplot2` library implements what is known as the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448). This makes it particularly effective for describing how visualizations should represent data, and has turned it into the preeminent plotting library in R.

This week will provide you the knowledge and skills required to create the meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned data visualizations that I will be looking for in your final project.

### Assignments

- This is the last homework.
- It's not complicated at all, so that you can spend more time on your final project. 


### Readings

- BEFORE next session's class, read:
    + Chapter 19 sections 19.1 through 19.6 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    + Chapter 21 sections 21.1 through 21.5 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- As you read, check your answers for the guided reading with [this solutions manual](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).
