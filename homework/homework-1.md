---


The goal of this simple homework assignment is to get you familiar with the markdown language and producing the various R Markdown reports.

This homework is due before class  There will be no flexibility on submission deadlines so if you have any software/technical issues we need to have these resolved by the end of class 


## Report to Create {#report}

I want you to create an R Notebook (.nb.html) document that contains the following information:

- Your name & UIC
- Where you are from along with some background information (i.e. education, employment, family, etc.)
- Your previous experience with R

I want you to name this file `xxx.nb.html` where xxx is your UIC number.
