title: Final Project
---


### Purpose

The purpose of this final project is to put to work the tools and knowledge that you gain throughout this course. This provides you with multiple benefits. 

1. It will provide you with more experience using data wrangling tools on real life data sets. 
2. It helps you become a self-directed learner. As a data scientist, a large part of your job is to self-direct your learning and interests to find unique and creative ways to find insights in data.
3. It starts to build your data science portfolio. Establishing a data science portfolio is a great way to show potential employers your ability to work with data.

The course is structured in a way that allows you to work on your project as you progress through the weeks. Thus, you *should* not have to cram during the last two weeks of the term to complete your project. Rather, I plan to have you work on the project and use some of the in-class time to do peer evaluation of your code.


### Project Goal

The principal goal of this project is to import an existing data set on the web, clean and tidy the data, and perform basic exploratory data analysis; all while using R Markdown to produce an HTML report that is fully reproducible. 

### Project Data

You will need to identify a data set that is freely available online. I have supplied several options below; however, you are free to choose a data set outside of these.  You will need to get your data set approved by me by. Considering this is a data wrangling class I do expect your data set to have certain qualities so that your analysis illustrates your knowledge of data wrangling.  The following are some data attributes that I will look for (but your data does not need to contain *all* of these attributes, just some):

- multiple data types (numerics, characters, dates, etc)
- non-normalized characteristics (may contain punctuations, upper and lowercase letters, etc)
- variables that need to be separated or joined
- two or more data sets that need to be merged
- wide or long format where you need to re-shape the data
- variables that need to be created (i.e. the data may contain income and expense variables but you want to analyze savings such that you need to create a savings variable out of the income and expense variables)
- data needs to be filtered out

Potential data sets include:

- [GDP by industry](http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=51&step=1#reqid=51&step=51&isuri=1&5114=q&5102=1)
- [Direct investments by country and industry](http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=2&step=1#reqid=2&step=10&isuri=1&202=1&203=30&204=1&205=1&200=1&201=1&207=30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,48,49,52&208=1&209=1)
- [American Community Survey data sets](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2014/)
- [Bureau of Labor Statistics data sets](http://www.bls.gov/data/)
- [Cincinnati police crime incident data](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safer-Streets/Police-Crime-Incident-Data/w7vh-beui)
- [City of Cincinnati vendor payments](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Growing-Economy/City-of-Cincinnati-Vendor-Payments/qrj9-83t8)
- [City of Cincinnati salary schedule](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Innovative-Government/City-of-Cincinnati-Salary-Schedule/yaws-h72m)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) data sets (lots to choose from!)

### Project Report

You will write an [R Markdown](http://wfu-r.github.io/r_markdown) HTML report that provides the following sections:

  <b>3.3</b> Data importing and cleaning steps are explained in the text (tell me why you are doing the data cleaning activities that you perform) and follow a logical process. <br>

  <b>3.5</b> Provide summary information about the variables of concern in your cleaned data set. Do not just print off a bunch of code chunks with <code>str()</code>, <code>summary()</code>, etc.  Rather, provide me with a consolidated explanation, either with a table that provides summary info for each variable or a nicely written summary paragraph with inline code.

I expect your report to tell a story with the data. I do not want you to just report some statistics that you find but, rather, to provide a coherent narrative of your findings. Here are some examples of the type of report that I am looking for: 

- [State-level savings rates](https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/final_project_example)
- [Undergraduate student diversity](http://rpubs.com/murphm6/233993)
- [AirBnB sentiment](http://rpubs.com/ishantnayer/234221)
- [Capital punishment in America](http://rpubs.com/hailce17/301571)
- [Ideal cities and states for analytic students](http://rpubs.com/dyang9411/301598)
- [Movie exploratory analysis](http://rpubs.com/yash91sharma/dw_project_ys)
- [AirBnB user pathways](http://rpubs.com/angiechen/234334)

Upon submission you will upload the final HTML report to RPubs and provide me with the URL. You will also submit the .Rmd file that produced the HTML report, your data, and any other files your .Rmd file leverages (images, .bib file, etc.). Your submitted files should be named with year, course number, lastname, first & middle initial, and then “finalproject.” For example my file name would be: 2018_BANA8090 _boehmkebc_finalproject.Rmd.  I expect to be able to fully reproduce your report by knitting your .Rmd file.


**Optional:**  For those who are more advanced or daring, I challenge you to develop a [Shiny app](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) using [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) to accompany your report. This will turn your exploratory data analysis into an interactive tool for users.  Here are some examples:

- [U.S. Savings Rates](https://bradleyboehmke.shinyapps.io/us_savings_rate_app/)
- [International Logistics Performance Index](https://bradleyboehmke.shinyapps.io/LPI_Rankings/)
- [Craft Beer in the U.S.](http://rpubs.com/steffanigomez/301609)
- [Co2 Emmissions](http://rpubs.com/AlinaC/final_project)
- [McDonald's Nutrition Facts](https://zhanb17.shinyapps.io/mcdonaldsnutrition/)


Any additional details regarding the final project will be provided in class.
